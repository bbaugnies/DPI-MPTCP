## URI: The URI to unescape.

##      Unescaping reserved characters may cause loss of information.
##      :rfc:`2396`: A URI is always in an "escaped" form, since escaping or
##      unescaping a completed URI might change its semantics.  Normally, the
##      only time escape encodings can safely be made is when the URI is
##      being created from its component parts.
