This concludes our work on Deep Packet Inspection with Multipath TCP. As we have seen, the development and deployment is not limited to conceptualizing it and implementing. For a protocol to achieve large scale success on today's internet, compliance with commonly used networking tools is just as important as good design. In addition to the common challenges of creating a new protocol, our overview of MPTCP has shown that this protocol in particular brings about new challenges that break many common assumptions on modern networks.\\

In an effort to improve existing tools to work with MPTCP, we have present the Bro IDS, a powerful and flexible tool to network analysis and intrusion detection. By explaining how the system functions, we exposed which parts needed to be worked on in order to allow Bro to understand and produce meaningful results with MPTCP. We discussed the two main components of Bro: the Event Engine which parses packets to raise events has been modified in order to transfer the binary MPTCP information contained in the TCP options to the powerful Policy Script Interpreter, and to do so in an easily understandable manner. With the new events being raised, we have been able to produce scripts which can exploit the information in order to showcase important behavior within the protocol. \\

While presenting the scripts, we outlined potential attacks that may be used in the future against the protocol. Doing so brings us back to original premise of the thesis; adapting network monitoring and security tools is essential to ensure that we will be able to detect and counteract future attacks. Off course, we have seen that there is still much that can be done. As the protocol matures and more and more people use it and work on it, it is most likely that new techniques for intrusion detection tailored to MPTCP will emerge. In the end, we must bare mind one thing; if MPTCP changes the way we send data, it will also make us change the way we observe these transfers.
