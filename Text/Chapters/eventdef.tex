\begin{code}

## Generated for each MPTCP option found in a TCP header (kind = 30) 
## In most cases, this event will be raised at least once for every
## packet in an MPTCP connection (read "very often if MPTCP is in use")
##
##
## c: The connection the packet is part of.
##
## is_orig: True if the packet was sent by the connection's originator.
##
## len: The length of the option's value.
##
## subtype: The numerical subtype of the option as defined by RFC6824
##
##
