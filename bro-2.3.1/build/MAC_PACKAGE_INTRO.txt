This package will install Bro into the following location:

    /usr/local/bro

You may choose to update your PATH environment variable:

    # For Bash
    export PATH=/usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH

    # For CSH
    setenv PATH /usr/local/bro/bin:$PATH
 
If you have more than one volume, please choose the install
destination as the one that contains the root filesystem.

If you have existing configuration files that are modified or
otherwise different from the version included in the package,
this installer will attempt to prevent overwirting them,
but its also advisable to make your own backups of important
files before proceeding.
